#### Instuctions for running the software

1. Initiliazation
    - For running the software for the **first time**, inside "landing/temporal" folder create a folder for each data source and put inside the data files.
    - For **uploading new data source versions** go to "landing/temporal" folder and inside the folder of the specific data source add the new data files.
    - Before moving on to step 2, make sure to change the paths in the "paths.py" file in the main folder of the project. Change only the paths where the indication "# CHANGE THIS" exists.
2. For execution of the software, you can run "main.py", which runs sequentally all the main scripts of the project in the right order.
    - The main scripts are named as follows: **s"X"_"name_of_the_script"**
        - where **"X"** is the order of execution and 
        - **"name_of_the_script"** is a small description of the content of the script.
